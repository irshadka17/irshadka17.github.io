## Welcome

I am a beamline scientist at Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste, working on high-pressure X-ray diffraction, synchrotron-based materials research, and scientific software development.
Experienced researcher specializing in advanced X-ray diffraction studies under extreme conditions. My work focuses on carrying out high-pressure, high/low-temperature experiments on various materials, leading to novel discoveries in materials science.

A key aspect of my professional experience involves developing novel experimental techniques for diamond anvil cell (DAC) based studies, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in extreme conditions research.

I have extensive experience in user support, serving as the local contact for supporting users conducting synchrotron experiments involving extreme condition X-ray diffraction measurements.

Additionally, I manage significant operational responsibilities at the beamline, which include:
Preparing and documenting monthly and yearly beamline reports.

Conducting technical evaluations of research proposals.

Overseeing the periodic maintenance of beamline facilities.

My expertise in both the technical execution of complex experiments and the operational management of a major scientific facility makes me a versatile and valuable asset to any research team.
